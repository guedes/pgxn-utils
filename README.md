pgxn utils
==========

What is it?
--------

It aims to be a set of task that aims to help PostgreSQL extension's developers to focus more on the problem that they wants to solve than in the all structure and files and control files need to PGXS to build the extension.

It's a WIP but very functional. Please use it and help me improve it.

How to install it?
------------------

    gem install pgxn_utils

How it works?
-------------

It is all about tasks. Let's see what tasks we have:

    $ pgxn_utils help
    Tasks:
      pgxn_utils bundle [extension_name]  # Bundles an extension
      pgxn_utils change [extension_name]  # Change META's attributes in current extension
      pgxn_utils help [TASK]              # Describe available tasks or one specific task
      pgxn_utils skeleton extension_name  # Creates an extension skeleton in current directory


# Creating a new extension

    $ pgxn_utils skeleton my_cool_extension
          create  my_cool_extension
          create  my_cool_extension/my_cool_extension.control
          create  my_cool_extension/META.json
          create  my_cool_extension/Makefile
          create  my_cool_extension/README.md
          create  my_cool_extension/doc/my_cool_extension.md
          create  my_cool_extension/sql/my_cool_extension.sql
          create  my_cool_extension/sql/uninstall_my_cool_extension.sql
          create  my_cool_extension/test/expected/base.out
          create  my_cool_extension/test/sql/base.sql

Thats it! Just start coding! ":)

# Changing something

Well suppose you want to change the default maintainer's name and the license, well just do:

    $ pgxn_utils change my_cool_extension --maintainer "Dickson Guedes" --license bsd
           exist  my_cool_extension
       identical  my_cool_extension/my_cool_extension.control
        conflict  my_cool_extension/META.json
    Overwrite /home/guedes/extensions/my_cool_extension/META.json? (enter "h" for help) [Ynaqdh] d
      {
         "name": "my_cool_extension",
         "abstract": "A short description",
         "description": "A long description",
         "version": "0.0.1",
    -    "maintainer": "The maintainer's name",
    +    "maintainer": "Dickson Guedes",
    -    "license": "postgresql",
    +    "license": "bsd",
         "provides": {
            "my_cool_extension": {
               "abstract": "A short description",
               "file": "sql/my_cool_extension.sql",
               "docfile": "doc/my_cool_extension.md",
               "version": "0.0.1"
            }
         },
         "release_status": "unstable",
      
         "generated_by": "The maintainer's name",
      
      
         "meta-spec": {
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "url": "http://pgxn.org/meta/spec.txt"
         }
      }
    Retrying...
    Overwrite /home/guedes/extensions/my_cool_extension/META.json? (enter "h" for help) [Ynaqdh]
           force  my_cool_extension/META.json
       identical  my_cool_extension/Makefile
    ...
    ...
    ...

It will wait you decide what to do.

For all switches that you can use with *change*, type:

    $ pgxn_utils help change
    Usage:
      pgxn_utils change [extension_name]

    Options:
      -m, [--maintainer=MAINTAINER]          # Maintainer's name <maintainer@email>
      -a, [--abstract=ABSTRACT]              # Defines a short description to abstract
      -l, [--license=LICENSE]                # The extension license.
      -v, [--version=VERSION]                # Initial version
      -d, [--description=DESCRIPTION]        # A long text that contains more information about extension
      -b, [--generated-by=GENERATED_BY]      # Name of extension's generator
      -t, [--tags=one two three]             # Defines extension's tags
      -r, [--release-status=RELEASE_STATUS]  # Initial extension's release status


# Bundling and Releasing!

Well, since you finished your work you can bundle it to send to [PGXN](http://pgxn.org).

Bundle it:

    $ pgxn_utils bundle my_cool_extension
    Extension generated at: /home/guedes/extensions/my_cool_extension-0.0.1.zip

and release it:

    $ pgxn_utils release my_cool_extension-0.0.1.zip
    Enter your PGXN username: guedes
    Enter your PGXN password: ******
    Trying to release my_cool_extension-0.0.1.zip ... released successfully!
    Visit: http://manager.pgxn.org/distributions/my_cool_extension/0.0.1

You can export `PGXN_USER` and `PGXN_PASSWORD` environment variables to avoid
type username and password everytime.
